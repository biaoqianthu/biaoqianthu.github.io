I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My research focuses on efficient learning and compression of deep neural networks, including knowledge distillation, generative modeling, network quantization, and model compression, with applications to computer vision.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Signal and Information Processing from the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Hefei University of Technology in 2024, where I also completed my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees. From 2024 to 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at Hefei University of Technology.

My recent work investigates data-free and generative paradigms for model compression, seeking principled solutions for deploying large-scale models under limited data and computational constraints.
